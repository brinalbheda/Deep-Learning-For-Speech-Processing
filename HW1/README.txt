HW1 folder contains 2 files - hw1_sox.py and hw1_lms.py

--Steps to run the code:

1. Change the directory to where the input audio files will be saved in the script on line 16.
2. Run hw1_sox.py from terminal.
3. Change the directory to where the output audio files will be saved in the script on line 16.
4. Run hw1_lms.py from terminal.

--What does this code do?

1. Downloading the pure audio signals like TedTalk for test and train inputs and also download car noise for noise input.
2. Mixing clean input with white noise.
3. Constructing a single layered neural network.
4. Training and testing the neural network.
5. Plotting the convergence graph for epochs versus loss.
6. Reconstructing the audio signal and comparing.
7. Plotting the denoised and reconstructed signal graphs and also the audio files.
